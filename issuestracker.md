## Core Problem: Villager Profession Persistence vs Movement

**Issue**: Villagers assigned professions either lose their profession after ~1 second OR freeze in place unable to move.

---

## Solution Attempts & Results

### 1. Virtual Workstation Implementation
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Method**: Create virtual JOB_SITE memory using villager's current position
**Implementation**:
- Set JOB_SITE and POTENTIAL_JOB_SITE memory modules with GlobalPos
- Used villager's current location as fake workstation
- Designed to trick AI into thinking villager has a workstation

**Result**: ❌ FAILED
**Issue**: Villager AI validates actual block presence, not just memory
**Log Evidence**: Profession still reverted after 1 second
**Status**: Abandoned approach

---

### 2. Skip Brain Reinitialization (Pure Avoidance)
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Method**: Avoid calling `villager.reinitializeBrain()` entirely
**Implementation**:
- Only set profession data without brain refresh
- Clear offers and set health as minimal refresh
- No brain reinitialization to prevent AI from checking workstation

**Result**: ⚠️ PARTIAL SUCCESS
**Success**: ✅ Villagers can move normally
**Failure**: ❌ Professions revert to "none" after ~1 second
**Log Evidence**:
```
[21:45:38] Villager 65 profession: minecraft:farmer
[21:45:39] PROFESSION REVERTED! Expected: minecraft:farmer, Actual: minecraft:none
```
**Issue**: Other game systems (AI ticks, chunk loading) call brain updates that reset profession
**Status**: Fragile solution, doesn't persist

---

### 3. Mixin Protection (Original Implementation)
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Method**: Intercept `setVillagerData` calls to prevent profession resets
**Implementation**:
- @Inject on setVillagerData method with cancellation
- Block ALL attempts to change profession to "none"
- Recursive prevention with isProcessing flag

**Result**: ❌ FAILED
**Success**: ✅ Profession persistence achieved
**Failure**: ❌ Villagers freeze in place, cannot move
**Issue**: Too aggressive - blocked legitimate villager data updates needed for AI
**Status**: Disabled due to movement issues

---

### 4. Selective Mixin Protection (Current Test)
**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Method**: Very selective profession reset prevention + brain reinitialization
**Implementation**:
- Only block profession changes to "none" when level/type stay same
- Allow ALL other villager data updates (level, type, other professions)
- Restore `reinitializeBrain()` for proper AI behavior
- Mixin protects against reversion during brain refresh

**Code Changes**:
```java
// Only intervene on automatic profession reversion
boolean isAutomaticReversion = (
    newProfession == VillagerProfession.NONE &&
    currentProfession != VillagerProfession.NONE &&
    currentProfession != VillagerProfession.NITWIT &&
    currentData.getLevel() == villagerData.getLevel() &&
    currentData.getType() == villagerData.getType()
);
```

**Result**: ⚠️ MIXED RESULTS
**Success**: ✅ Profession persistence achieved ("Profession successfully persisted!")
**Failure**: ❌ Villagers still cannot move
**Log Evidence**:
```
[21:49:20] Profession successfully persisted!
[21:49:24] Final villager 65 profession: minecraft:farmer
```
**Issue**: Mixin still interferes with AI updates needed for movement
**Status**: Current state - professions work but movement broken

---

## Root Cause Analysis

**Core Conflict**: Minecraft's villager AI system has two incompatible requirements:
1. **Brain Updates**: Required for movement, pathfinding, and normal behavior
2. **Workstation Validation**: Brain updates check for workstations and reset profession to "none" if missing

**The Fundamental Problem**:
- Without workstations, ANY brain update will reset profession to "none"
- Without brain updates, villagers cannot move or behave normally
- Blocking brain updates prevents movement
- Allowing brain updates destroys profession persistence

---

## Technical Details

### Minecraft's Villager AI Flow:
1. **Brain Tick** (every game tick) → **Workstation Check** → **Reset to "none" if no workstation**
2. **reinitializeBrain()** → **Complete AI reset** → **Workstation validation** → **Profession reset**
3. **setVillagerData()** calls happen during AI updates for legitimate reasons

### Our Intervention Points:
- **setVillagerData()**: Too broad - blocks legitimate updates
- **reinitializeBrain()**: Can't avoid - needed for movement
- **Brain memory**: Virtual workstations don't work - AI validates blocks

---

## Next Steps to Try

### Option A: Even More Selective Mixin
- Target specific brain update methods instead of setVillagerData
- Allow setVillagerData but block profession-specific brain logic

### Option B: Custom AI Behavior
- Replace villager brain with custom implementation
- Maintain profession without workstation dependency

### Option C: NBT Persistence
- Store profession in persistent NBT data
- Restore profession after any AI reset

### Option D: Workstation Simulation
- Actually place invisible/fake workstation blocks
- Remove them immediately after validation

## NEW DISCOVERY: Trade Locking Solution

**Breakthrough**: Villagers who have traded CANNOT lose their profession - it becomes permanently locked!

### 3 Trade Locking Strategies:

#### Strategy 1: Experience Manipulation ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Method**: Use `setExperience()` to mark villager as "traded"
**Implementation**:
```java
villager.setExperience(250); // Master level = profession locked
villager.setVillagerData(villagerData.withLevel(5)); // Visual update
```
**Pros**: ✅ Official API, ✅ Clean, ✅ Persists saves, ✅ Visual feedback
**Cons**: ⚠️ Villager appears as master level

#### Strategy 2: Trade Offer Manipulation
**Method**: Create fake used-up trades to simulate trading history
**Implementation**: Generate TradeOffers with maxUses reached
**Pros**: ✅ Realistic trading history, ✅ Granular control
**Cons**: ⚠️ Complex, ⚠️ May interfere with natural trades

#### Strategy 3: NBT Data Manipulation
**Method**: Direct NBT modification of experience and trade data
**Implementation**: Write custom NBT with trade history and experience
**Pros**: ✅ Most direct, ✅ Bypasses all validation
**Cons**: ⚠️ Fragile, ⚠️ Requires careful NBT structure

---

## SOLUTION FOUND! ✅ COMPLETE SUCCESS

### Strategy 1: Experience Manipulation - WORKING PERFECTLY

**Date**: 2025-09-14
**Method**: Set villager experience to master level (250 XP) to lock profession
**Implementation**:
```java
villager.setExperience(250); // Master level = profession locked
villager.setVillagerData(villagerData.withLevel(5)); // Visual consistency
villager.reinitializeBrain(serverWorld); // Normal AI behavior
```

**Results**:
- ✅ **Profession Persistence**: All professions locked permanently
- ✅ **Villager Movement**: Normal AI behavior, villagers move freely
- ✅ **Trade Functionality**: Master level trading available
- ✅ **No Mixins Required**: Uses vanilla mechanics
- ✅ **Brain Updates Safe**: reinitializeBrain() works without issues

**Log Evidence**:
```
[22:16:29] Profession successfully persisted!
[22:16:45] Profession successfully persisted!
[22:16:59] Profession successfully persisted!
```

**Why It Works**: Leverages Minecraft's built-in mechanic where experienced/traded villagers cannot lose their profession. By setting experience to master level, villagers appear as "traded" and retain professions forever.
