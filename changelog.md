## Change Log for Xeenaa Village Picker

All notable changes and decisions made during the development of this project will be documented in this file.

### [Phase 6 - Networking & Profession Persistence] - 2025-09-14 ⚠️ IN PROGRESS

#### Added - Client-Server Communication
- **SelectProfessionPacket**: Complete network packet implementation for Minecraft 1.21.1
  - Uses modern CustomPayload system with PacketCodec for serialization
  - Record-based packet structure (villagerEntityId, professionId)
  - Proper PayloadTypeRegistry registration for C2S communication
  - Type-safe packet handling with validation

- **ServerPacketHandler**: Comprehensive server-side packet processing
  - Global packet receiver registration using ServerPlayNetworking
  - Multi-threaded safe processing with server thread execution
  - Distance validation (8-block radius to prevent cheating)
  - Baby villager restriction handling
  - Entity existence and type validation
  - Profession registry validation

#### Added - Profession Persistence System
- **Debugging Infrastructure**: Comprehensive logging system
  - Debug logs for profession change process with timestamps
  - Memory state inspection (JOB_SITE, POTENTIAL_JOB_SITE tracking)
  - Delayed checks at 1-tick, 1-second, and 5-second intervals
  - Brain memory enumeration for troubleshooting

- **Virtual Workstation Implementation**: Advanced persistence solution
  - Creates virtual JOB_SITE memory using villager's current position
  - Sets both JOB_SITE and POTENTIAL_JOB_SITE memory modules
  - Uses GlobalPos with proper world registry key
  - Designed to prevent profession reversion during reinitializeBrain()

#### Issues Identified & Attempted Solutions
- **Profession Reversion Problem**: Professions assigned but immediately removed
  - **Root Cause**: `villager.reinitializeBrain()` causes profession reversion after ~1 second
  - **Analysis**: Villager brain evaluates situation and reverts to "none" without workstation
  - **Debug Results**: Comprehensive logs show exact timing and cause of reversion

- **Solution Attempts**:
  1. **Option 1**: Skip brain reinitialization (fragile, breaks on other mod interference)
  2. **Option 2**: Find persistent profession flag (API limitations)
  3. **Option 3**: Virtual workstation approach (implemented but still testing)

#### Technical Implementation - Network Architecture
- **Packet Registration**: Modern Minecraft 1.21.1 networking patterns
  - PayloadTypeRegistry.playC2S() for client-to-server packets
  - ServerPlayNetworking.registerGlobalReceiver() for server handlers
  - Proper packet codec implementation with type safety

- **Server-Side Validation**: Multiple security layers
  - Entity existence validation before processing
  - Profession registry validation to prevent invalid professions
  - Player permission system foundation (expandable)
  - Distance checks to prevent remote exploitation

- **Virtual Workstation Logic**: Brain memory manipulation
  - Creates GlobalPos pointing to villager's current location
  - Stores in JOB_SITE memory module to satisfy brain requirements
  - Additional POTENTIAL_JOB_SITE memory for reinforcement
  - Designed to survive reinitializeBrain() calls

#### Current Status - Testing Phase
- **Network Communication**: ✅ WORKING - Packets properly sent and received
- **Profession Assignment**: ✅ WORKING - Professions successfully applied
- **Persistence Issue**: ⚠️ TESTING - Virtual workstation approach implemented, results pending
- **Comprehensive Logging**: ✅ WORKING - Full debug information available

#### Next Steps
- **Log Analysis**: Review detailed logs to understand virtual workstation effectiveness
